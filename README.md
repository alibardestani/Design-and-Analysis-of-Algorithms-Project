Design and Analysis of Algorithms Project - 0/1 Knapsack

Objective of in this project is to tackle the 0/1 Knapsack Problem (KP). In order to attempt that you 
should suggest at least three algorithms based on your course topics that you think they can lead you 
to the optimal solution.

I implemented the code of this project using the Python language and used greedy algorithms and
dynamic programming, although it did not give us the most optimal answer, but it gave us
the answer with a small error rate and in a low time.
